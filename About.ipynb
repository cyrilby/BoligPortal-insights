As a part of this process, we download data on all rentals in the Greater Copenhagen and clean it up so that it can be used for analytical purposes. The cleaned-up data is stored in the `Data` folder.\n","\n","### Learn more about the data scraping and cleaning\n","\n","For more information on the kind of data collected and the specifics of the method used, please refer to the `BoligPortal data scraping and prep.ipynb` notebook."],"metadata":{"id":"bQUYwUy3VB5q"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Exploratory data analysis\n","\n","After the data is sourced and cleaned, the actual analysis begins. At this stage, we're only looking into inferential statistics, where we explore various variables by looking at a series of different charts. It is in this part that we get to know what data is available and how the data looks like in practice.\n","\n","In this part, we explore both continuous and categorical varibales. We use histograms and boxplots to investigate the distribution of continuous variables, while categorical variables are mostly explored using pie charts and barplots. Some scatter plots are used to visualize the correlation between categorical variables, while geolocation data is plotted on a map.\n","\n","### Learn more about the exploratory analysis\n","\n","For more details, please refer to the `BoligPortal exploratory analysis.ipynb` notebook."],"metadata":{"id":"rlr8SfSQV5IS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Statistical data analysis\n","\n","The exploratory analysis has inspired a number of different hypotheses that are being put to the test in the next stage of the project.

However, even though model fit is evaluated and commented on, the analysis doesn't focus on maximizing predictive power or producing a more robust model that could also be applied to data outside of the sample.\n","\n","For these purposes, a separate predictive analysis is carried out, where several different machine learning (ML) models are utilized (random forest regression, to be specific). The data is split into `75:25` training vs. test set so that the models are developed based on the training data but evaluated based on how well they predict based on the test data. In order to improve the predictive power, further data is added and an automated parameters hypertuning is performed.\n","\n","### Learn more about the predictive analysis\n","\n","For more details, please refer to the `BoligPortal predictive analysis.ipynb` notebook."],"metadata":{"id":"5CkBXBnpX89i"}}]}
